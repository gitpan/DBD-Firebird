REQUIREMENTS:
  - Perl (Threaded and version 5.8.1 or higher)
  - Perl DBI (1.41 or higher)
  - Firebird (2.5.1 or higher)
  - A C compiler
    * UN*X
      GCC 4.x (tested, older may or may not work) or other capable
      clang

    * Windows
      - Strawberry perl (http://strawberryperl.com/) comes with it's own compiler (mingw) 
      - or Microsoft Express VC++ 9 (2008) /10 (2010) /11
      - Cygwin
    * Freebsd 
      - Threaded perl is required (You have to re-install perl from ports and you have to select the config
      option that says 'build a perl with threads')


*BEFORE* BUILDING, TESTING AND INSTALLING this you will need to:

  - Build, test and install Perl 5 (at least 5.8.1).
    It is very important to TEST it and INSTALL it!

  - Build, test and install the DBI module (at least DBI 1.41).
    It is very important to TEST it and INSTALL it!
    On Debian/Ubuntu you can do a simple:
      sudo apt-get install firebird2.5-dev libdbi-perl

  - Remember to *read* the DBI README file if you installed it from source

  - Make sure that Firebird server is running (for testing telnet localhost 3050)
    


BUILDING:
  Win32/Win64 with Strawberry 
    type 'dmake' from the console 

  Win32/Win64 with MS compiler:
    type 'nmake', not just 'make'

  To Configure and build the DBD:
    perl Makefile.PL
    make

TESTING
  To run tests module Test::Exception is required on Debian/Ubuntu systems:
     sudo apt-get install libtest-exception-perl
     
  Please, set at least DBI_PASS (or ISC_PASSWORD), before 'make test'.
  The default for DBI_USER is 'SYSDBA'.(masterkey password is given here as example only)
    ISC_PASSWORD=masterkey make test

INSTALLING:
    make install               (if the tests look okay)
